# ICP EVM Starter Template

This repository is using the ICP EVM Starter template and building a cross-chain solution on top of it for a hackathon.

## Overview

This project leverages the Internet Computer (ICP) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to create a cross-chain solution. The goal is to enable seamless interactions between smart contracts deployed on different blockchain networks.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Interactions**: Facilitates communication between smart contracts on ICP and Ethereum.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Utilizes the EVM for executing smart contracts.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high transaction volumes efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust
- Node.js
- DFX (Internet Computer SDK)
- Truffle (Ethereum development framework)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anand008186/chain-fusion-hackathon.git
