# CrossChain Marketplace

This repository is using the ICP EVM Starter template and building a cross-chain marketplace solution on top of it for a hackathon.

## Overview

This project leverages the Internet Computer (ICP) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to create a cross-chain marketplace. The goal is to enable users to upload new tasks and offer rewards in ICP or other cryptocurrencies from any chain. Participants can then select and complete tasks (e.g., providing the best caption for a thumbnail).

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Interactions**: Facilitates communication between smart contracts on ICP and Ethereum.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Utilizes the EVM for executing smart contracts.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high transaction volumes efficiently.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Uses ICP to store users' assets, ensuring full decentralization.
